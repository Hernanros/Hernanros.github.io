## Hernan Rosenblum work portfolio<br>
<sub>Hi, I'm Hernan <br>
I will use this repository to share some of the projects that I'm working on to practice and imrove my skills as a data scientist. <br>
I started to explore the field of data science, some 2 years ago during my M.A studies.<br>
Since then I've learned how to write queries in SQL like a pro, and how to use python packages for all sorts of data science usages, how to build suffisticated deep models and how to work on collaborative data projects.<br>
I have a strong understanding of quantitative research methods and a passion for structural problem-solving.<br>
If you have a project idea, a collaboration offer, or if you would like to comment on some of my work, you can contact me at LinkedIn or mail</sub>
